## ðŸ§  Why This Project?

I created MindMate as part of the **Stanford Code in Place 2025** program to explore how simple Python code can simulate emotional support and human connection. While it's not a replacement for therapy, it's an example of how code can bring empathy and care into everyday digital tools.
